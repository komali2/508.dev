## What's hard?

The internet.

## What's so hard about the internet?

    Designing is hard. A design has to be attractive, implementable, accessible, and understandable.

    Building is hard. You have to choose a tool, balance speed against good code practice, and consider rapidly changing web technologies.

    Hosting is hard. Depending on your build strategy, you could have hundreds of possible hosting strategies, let alone thousands of hosting providers. How do you know which are good? How do you know you're getting your money's worth?

    Maintenance is hard, and annoying. How do you balance maintaining old features while building new ones? How do you decide when to upgrade?

    Billing can be hard to nightmarish depending on your service model and payment methods. Billing can also cut into your bottom line for every transactiona.

## Designing

You've started a company, you're releasing a product line, you're organizing a conference, you're doing something that you need to have an internet resource for, that's fantastic news! But... how should it look? What features should it have, and what's the best way to present those features? Are you going to design it yourself? Using what tools? Are you going to outsource the design? To an agency? Who? Are you going to hire a designer? How do you find a good one?

These are all questions we've answered many ways here at 508.dev. We figured we might as well write what we learned down:

* Designing Websites in 2022
* Hiring Design Agency Best Practices

Need more information? Send us an email at hello@508.dev, we'll let you know what we know, who we've worked with that we trust, or if you'd like, we can work with you directly for a design solution, like we've done with other clients.

## Building

Either you have a design or you're going to jump feet-first into a website or app without one (brave!), whatever path you take, you need to build something. The internet can be so desceptively simple: in the end, everything you're looking at is just HTML, right? (kind of!) Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, there are thousands of ways to generate that HTML, depending on your needs, what you're trying to build, what your hosting strategy will be, how you'll generate content, and how you plan on maintaining your website or application.

At 508.dev we think it's all gotten a bit too complicated, so it's been our goal to make building apps and websites as simple as possible for our clients. We've written some of what we learned below, but if you have any questions, or even just need some advice, feel free to email us at hello@508.dev .

* Do We Need a Web App or a Web Site?
* Three Hundred Ways to Build Stuff for the Internet

If you just neeed something built, that's also something we can handle. Send us an email and we can help figure out if we're a good fit for your needs: hello@508.dev .


## Hosting

You've designed something, you built it, now you have some files and you need to have them served (or a program you need to have run) in a way that other people can see them in their browsers or phones. So, who's going to rent you a computer and configure everything in a way that makes the forces that run the internet happy to serve your content? The good news is, there's probably not an industry on earth with more rich competition than the world of web hosting. The bad news is, well, the same news, because all that competition means you have your work cut out for you choosing. Luckily for you, here at 508.dev, we've made this choice a many times, and we don't lock ourselves into one vendor out of convenience: we're always seeking the best value proposition for our clients, and written about our experiences doing so:

* How Do I Put Stuff on the Internet?
* Static Websites vs App Servers
* How to Ensure You're Getting Your Money's Worth from Your Hosting Provider

## Security

One of the most fraught, and in our experience, misunderstood subjects in the world of internet business applications. On the one hand you have literally millions of unsecured app leaking customer and employee data to anybody with an internet connection, and on the other you have fear mongering companies charging clients for security services that at best are something their clients could easily manage on their own with a little helpful information (read below!), at middling are services that don't actually do anything, and at worse implement back doors that they can turn around sell to black market clients.

Security doesn't have to be scary. Good security is getting easier every day to implement, and depending on your needs, you probably don't need to pay somebody else to handle this for you. If you're worried and want to know whether you should look into getting a security audit or seeking a network security certification of some kind, feel free to email us at hello@508.dev and we can have a quick convo about whether you need to go out of your way like that. In the meantime, see if what we've learned over the years while serving our clients can help you, help yourself:

* It Isn't Hard to Get HTTPS


## Maintenance

Too many wonderful websites rot slowly, unusable within even a few months of being built, and for no good reason! Updating plugins, renewing HTTPS certificates, patching security vulnerabilities, fixing broken links and APIs, the house cleaning for a website or webapp never really ends, but if your web stuff is built right, hopefully you won't have to spend too much time over the years on maintenance. 508.dev has been around for a while, and we've learned a few things about keeping maintenance costs down:

* Website Biannual Maintenance Checklist
* When to Upgrade an Old Site

Of course, if you just want some experts on retainer to keep an eye on things for you, we can help find you someone, or take care of that ourselves. Send us an email at hello@508.dev to start a conversation about whether this is something you need to be outsourcing.


## Billing

Websites are fun, but making money is even more fun. Whether you're charging for your ecommerce site, access to your online classes or articles, or charging for tickets, somehow, you need to get money from your customer's pockets, and into yours, in a way that makes everyone involved feel safe.

Billing is an interesting space in the internet world. Billing related features are the most obvious targets for hacking, and for the same reason off-the-shelf tools are often some of the most secure products you plug into your website. On the other hand, good competition is slim, because between regulation and integration with various payment methods (credit card, bank transfer, etc), there's only really a few companies that have reasonable products on the market for collecting money. They're not *too* hard to get running on your own, take a read of what we've learned setting up billing for our clients and see if you can manage it, if not, setting up online billing is something we can help you with.
