## What's so hard about the internet?

    {{<card title="Designing"  icon="geometry">}}
    Designing is hard. A design has to be attractive, implementable, accessible, and understandable.
    {{</card>}}
    {{<card title="Building"  icon="hammer">}}
    Building is hard. You have to choose a tool, balance speed against good code practice, and consider rapidly changing web technologies.
    {{</card>}}
    {{<card title="Hosting"  icon="server">}}
    Hosting is hard. Depending on your build strategy, you could have hundreds of possible hosting strategies, let alone thousands of hosting providers. How do you know which are good? How do you know you're getting your money's worth?
    {{</card>}}
    {{<card title="Securing"  icon="shield-lock">}}
    Security is hard. Very, very hard, and the consequences of getting it wrong are dire.
    {{</card>}}
    {{<card title="Maintaining"  icon="bandage">}}
    Maintenance is hard, and annoying. How do you balance maintaining old features while building new ones? How do you decide when to upgrade?

    {{<card title="Billing"  icon="receipt">}}
    Billing can be hard to nightmarish depending on your service model and payment methods. Billing can also cut into your bottom line for every transactiona.

## Designing

You've started a company, you're releasing a product line, you're organizing a conference, you're doing something that you need to have an internet resource for, that's fantastic news! But... how should it look? What features should it have, and what's the best way to present those features? Are you going to design it yourself? Using what tools? Are you going to outsource the design? To an agency? Who? Are you going to hire a designer? How do you find a good one?

These are all questions we've answered many ways here at 508.dev. We figured we might as well write what we learned down:

Need more information? Send us an email at hello@508.dev, we'll let you know what we know, who we've worked with that we trust, or if you'd like, we can work with you directly for a design solution, like we've done with other clients.

## Building

Either you have a design or you're going to jump feet-first into a website or app without one (brave!), whatever path you take, you need to build something. The internet can be so desceptively simple: in the end, everything you're looking at is just HTML, right? (kind of!) Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, there are thousands of ways to generate that HTML, depending on your needs, what you're trying to build, what your hosting strategy will be, how you'll generate content, and how you plan on maintaining your website or application.

At 508.dev we think it's all gotten a bit too complicated, so it's been our goal to make building apps and websites as simple as possible for our clients. We've written some of what we learned below, but if you have any questions, or even just need some advice,
